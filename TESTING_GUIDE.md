# Formula Suggestions Testing Guide

## âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **Improved Token Matching**

- Changed from `split(/[^A-Z]/g).pop()` to `match(/([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*)$/i)?.[0]`
- Now properly handles partial function names like "SU" for "SUM"

### 2. **Better Suggestion Application**

- Fixed the replacement logic to properly replace the partial token
- Uses regex matching to find and replace the last typed function name

### 3. **Prevented Focus Loss**

- Added `onMouseDown={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` to FormulaSuggestions
- Added `isApplyingSuggestion` state to prevent premature onBlur events
- Now clicking on suggestions won't close the input field

### 4. **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation**

- Both Tab and Enter now apply suggestions when suggestions are visible
- Escape key properly hides suggestions or cancels editing
- Arrow keys navigate through suggestions properly

## ðŸ§ª **How to Test:**

### **In Formula Bar (Top):**

1. Click on the formula bar input
2. Type `=SU` - should show SUM function
3. Type `=AV` - should show AVERAGE function
4. Use arrow keys to navigate suggestions
5. Press Tab or Enter to apply

### **In Cell Editing (New Feature):**

1. Double-click any cell (or press F2)
2. Type `=` to start a formula
3. Type `SU` - should show SUM suggestion
4. Use arrow keys to navigate
5. Press Tab/Enter to apply, or click to select
6. Type `COUNT` - should show COUNT functions
7. Test with various functions: MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, etc.

## ðŸš€ **Key Improvements:**

- **Real-time suggestions**: Updates as you type
- **Click to select**: Can click on suggestions without losing focus
- **Better regex**: More accurate function name detection
- **Consistent behavior**: Same experience in formula bar and cell editing
- **Proper positioning**: Suggestions appear below the cell being edited

## ðŸŽ¯ **Test Cases:**

- Type `=S` â†’ Should show SUM, SQRT, SIN, etc.
- Type `=AV` â†’ Should show AVERAGE
- Type `=CO` â†’ Should show COUNT, CONCATENATE, etc.
- Type `=IF` â†’ Should show IF function
- Use keyboard navigation (â†‘â†“) and selection (Tab/Enter)
- Click suggestions with mouse
- Test Escape key to hide suggestions
